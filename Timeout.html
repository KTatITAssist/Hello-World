	<h2>What does Timout for Women offer?</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>An oasis in the week to meet with other women to study the Bible, pray and generally meet with God, otherwise known as 'fellowship'.</li>
	<li>A small group setting for those in a home group who also value meeting with other women, or for those who can't or don't want to join a home group.</li>
	<li>A lifeline for mothers with small children who just want five minutes of peace to themselves to enjoy cake, coffee, chat and time with God.</li>
	<li>A chance to make new friends and get to know other women at Greyfriars.</li>
	<li>People to share your troubles and joys with who can offer a wealth of wisdom, sympathy and help.</li>
	<li>An opportunity for your pre-schoolers to get to know the other children at church.</li>
</ul>

 	<h4>Social Events</h4>
    <p>Our next social event is the Women's breakfast to be held at Greyfriar's Church on dd/mm/yy at 9am.</p>
    <h4>Annual Weekend away</h4>
    <p>For the past 2 years, this has taken place at Warbrook House in Eversley. It is an opportunity to get away from it all and focus on God and yourself. Our next weekend away will take place in 2017 (date to still be confirmed). <br></br>
We're keen to cater for as many women as possible so if you have any other suggestions, please contact us.
